## Code challenge - Shortcut

Swift with UIKit

Simulator iPhone 14 Pro

* A random comic is shown when the app opens.
* Browse through the comics with a button that show a random comic everytime.
* An explanation with more details can be found on the info button.
* A specific number of a comic can be searched for, but not the title, therefore a numberpad is used for the keyboard.
* If a comic does not exists an alert will give this information to the user.
* Activity like sending a comic is done with url string for webpage "https://xkcd.com/\(comicNumber)/"
* Core data for choosing favorite comic is started on, but incomplete. I used a bit of time on this, but moved on to implement other functionality like those mentioned above.
